# PorkChop
Soundtag Batch Converter
It like, opens up all the sound tags inside a folder, and, like, ticks the checkbox that says  "Split Long Sounds Into Permutations"

Then like, it changes each permutation to point to the next one.

So that like, they'll like all play, like one after the other.

Also if you like this, you should like use this program first;

That, like, converts your music to a .sound tag, then you would like use PorkChop on it.

Hope you like it!
